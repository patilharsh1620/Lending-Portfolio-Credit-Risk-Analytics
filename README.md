# 📊 Lending Portfolio & Credit Risk Analytics

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes end-to-end lending lifecycle data to evaluate
borrower behavior, approval trends, portfolio performance, and early
credit risk indicators. The objective was to simulate data-driven
underwriting and portfolio diagnostics similar to analytics functions in
NBFC and fintech lending environments.

The analysis focuses on identifying conversion bottlenecks, segment-wise
risk concentration, and exposure patterns to support structured lending
decisions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🎯 Business Objectives

-   Perform funnel analysis (Application → Approval → Disbursal)\
-   Track cohort-level repayment behavior\
-   Analyze early delinquency and risk signals\
-   Compute portfolio-level exposure and approval metrics\
-   Support underwriting decisions on borrower eligibility and exposure
    sizing

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used

-   SQL (Joins, Aggregations, CTEs, Window Functions)\
-   Python (Pandas, NumPy)\
-   Power BI\
-   Jupyter Notebook

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 📊 Key Analyses Performed

### 1️⃣ Lending Funnel Analysis

-   Measured conversion rates across application, approval, and
    disbursal stages\
-   Identified drop-offs impacting approval efficiency

### 2️⃣ Cohort & Delinquency Analysis

-   Tracked borrower repayment behavior across time-based cohorts\
-   Evaluated early delinquency trends across borrower segments

### 3️⃣ Portfolio Diagnostics

-   Calculated Approval Rate and Disbursal Rate\
-   Analyzed Exposure Distribution across segments\
-   Identified risk concentration patterns

### 4️⃣ Underwriting Simulation

-   Evaluated how adjustments in approval thresholds impact portfolio
    risk\
-   Assessed borrower attributes influencing risk exposure

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 📈 Key Insights

-   Identified stages with highest conversion drop-offs in the lending
    funnel\
-   Observed segment-level variation in delinquency rates indicating
    differential credit risk\
-   Highlighted exposure concentration in specific borrower clusters\
-   Demonstrated how structured analytics can support data-backed
    underwriting decisions

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🚀 Outcome

This project demonstrates practical application of credit risk
analytics, portfolio monitoring, and underwriting support logic. It
reflects a structured approach to transforming raw lending data into
actionable insights for risk management and lending strategy
optimization.
